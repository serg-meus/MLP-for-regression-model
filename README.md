# MLP-for-regression-model
This is a project directed to develop an Artificial Neural Network or Multi-Layer Perceptron for a regression model, able to predict the miles per gallon performance of an auto, using Pytorch. The main objective of this project is to train a regression artificial neural network that, while predicting the mileage per gallon based on certain features of a car, achieves the lowest loss or cost: root square mean error.

This repository contains one ipynb file and one csv file.

The unique ipynb files is:
1. "MLP for regression model.ipynb" - This code is used to: (1) explore the initial data, (2) preprocess and clean the data, (3) do feature engineering, and (4) train and test a deep learning regression model.

The unique csv file is:
"autos mpg.csv" - This is the original and initial dataset, extracted from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/autompg-dataset
